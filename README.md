# Python Tkinter Unit Conversion Tool

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for unit conversion. It allows you to convert units of length, weight, and temperature among various unit systems.

## Installation

To use this application, you need Python 3.x installed on your machine. Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python for Windows. If you're using Linux or MacOS, you might need to install Tkinter separately.

After ensuring Python and Tkinter are installed, download the `conversion_tool.py` file from the repository.

## Usage

Run the application by typing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python3 conversion_tool.py

## Specification
The application presents three sections for unit conversion:

- Length Conversion:
Choose the 'from' and 'to' units among kilometers (km), meters (m), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), miles (mi), yards (yd), feet (ft), or inches (in). Enter the value to be converted and click 'Calculate'.

- Weight Conversion:
Choose the 'from' and 'to' units among kilograms (kg), grams (g), pounds (lb), or ounces (oz). Enter the value to be converted and click 'Calculate'.

- Temperature Conversion:
